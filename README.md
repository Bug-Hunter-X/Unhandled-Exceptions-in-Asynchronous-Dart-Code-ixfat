# Unhandled Exceptions in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common issue in asynchronous Dart programming: insufficient exception handling. The `bug.dart` file contains code that fetches data from an API.  The code includes a `try-catch` block; however, the exception handling is quite generic and could be greatly improved. This makes debugging challenging and might mask crucial errors.

The improved version (`bugSolution.dart`) shows how to better handle exceptions by using more specific exception types (if possible) and providing more informative error messages.
